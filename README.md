## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS/SASS
- Javascript


### What I learned

This challenge was very useful to make me improve my CSS Grid and organize the div's using it. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: grid; 
}
```


### Continued development

I intend to keep going even more now that I finished my first challenge Junior level! I want to continue learning a lot of new things, such as React and typescript.
